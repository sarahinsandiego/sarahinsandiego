## 👋 Hi, I’m Sarah! Nice to meet you!

### I'm a remote web developer with 10+ years experience living in San Diego, CA with the ability to work remotely in any timezone.
- 💻 I've been immersed in the world of open source for 10 years and counting, and am passionate about all the amazing advantages open source communities have for furthering the world of tech. Currently, I'm working full-time as a Cloud Evangelist talking and teaching about PostgreSQL in the cloud. (But, I'm still looking to do a little more!)
- 👀 Robotics, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and the environment are all fascinating topics to me. Star Wars also has hefty influence in my world of interests.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about ReactJS, Vue, Angular, PostgreSQL, and cloud platform providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- 🎻 An interesting side note about me - I've been playing violin for 22 years, & viola for 10! (Yes, I do offer remote coaching sessions.)
### Looking for some additional challenges and fun projects!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project seeking a frontend developer who can cover HTML, CSS, JavaScript / JQuery, CMS implementation, JAMStack, Hugo, HubSpot, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or Wordpress. I can work independently or as a team player in any time zone, and can implement mockups, improve existing designs, or create my own implementations of content. All code has a minimal footprint, is well documented and tested, and results in responsive, accessible, and pixel-perfect presentations of your content.
- ⛰️ I'm not bothered by challenges. If it's not on my resume, I'm able to apply the logic of other frameworks I've used over the years to pick up that technology with best practices and efficient implementations.
- 💬 I have a ton of experience around event organization, social media management, technical writing, leadership, diversity programs, adult education, public speaking, and customer satisfaction. If you think I can be of help as a tech or team lead, a coach, or a consultant, I'm happy to learn more about your needs.
### Reach out anytime.
- 📫 Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-conway-05785570/) or send an email to sarah.beth.conway (at) gmail.com! Looking forward to hearing about your project and how we might be able to collaborate.
